### Question 1a

- Training dataset: **11280** items, **784** features  
- Test dataset: **1880** items, **784** features  

---

### Question 1b

- Image dimensions inferred: **28 × 28**  
- Selected classes for 1b: **[27, 39, 26, 43]**

---

### Question 1c

- Selected classes for 1c: **27, 39**  
- Discussion:  
  If the two clusters are well-separated in the t-SNE plot, it suggests potential **linear separability**.  
  Overlapping clusters indicate likely **non-separability**.

### Question 1d

- Explanation:  
  A **higher peak** of high similarity values in the histogram for **subset1** indicates that images within the same class are **more similar** to each other.  
  The **flatter histogram** for **subset2** shows that randomly selected images are **less similar** overall.
