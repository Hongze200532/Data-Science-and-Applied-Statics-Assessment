- Q1 breakdown [2,2,4,5] The answer to question 1 is good overall. However, for item ©, you use TSNE instead of PCA. Also, for item (d), you should have plotted both histograms on the same graph to spot similarities and differences easily. As it is shown, that is not clear, as your sample is very small, and the distances are very small.; 
- Q2 breakdown [7, 6, 5 ,6] good work on KNN, only turned one hyperparameter for LR and RF. but no CV curves for the classifiers. Kmeans did well. ; 
- Q3 breakdown [3, 5, 2, 2, 0, 4]
  - 3a: units missing on plot.
  - 3b: no units on plot.
  - 3c: should have used Z-test, seeing that variance is known.
  - 3d: all marks awarded.
  - 3e: you were not supposed to compute the sum Y. 3f: all marks awarded.; 
- Q4 breakdown [8, 3, 6, 6]
  - 4a: I don't think we used 'polyfit' for model fitting in the Applied Stats worksheets (no marls deducted), the discussion should have distinguished between different uses of the model, i.e. inference vs prediction, was expecting to see model selection.
  - 4b_i: data should be from an exponential distribution; I don't think you are actually fitting a GLM with a Gamma distribution using curve_fit (not used in labs!); should have discussed general shortcomings in the statistical reporting.
  - 4b_ii: toy data does not qualitatively capture the features shown in the coursework brief (trend in residuals in addition to heteroscedasticity); missing from your discussion is a statement that the info provided is insufficient to assess the statement about the x effect.
  - 4b_iii: all marks awarded.
